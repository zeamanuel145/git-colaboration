# Contact Us Page Collaboration

## Contributors:

- Student A (Form Layout & Styling)
- Student B (Form Validation & Submission)

## Project Overview

A simple, responsive "Contact Us" page built collaboratively using Git and GitHub workflows. The form collects name, email, and message, validates inputs, and displays a confirmation on successful submission.

## Features

- Responsive layout with clean styling
- Required fields with basic validation
- Valid email format enforcement
- Confirmation message on successful submission

## Collaboration Summary

We collaborated remotely by:

- Conducting a virtual meeting to split tasks and define branch conventions
- Working independently on feature branches
- Conducting peer code reviews with actionable feedback
- Simulating a merge conflict in `README.md` and resolving it together via video call

## Conflict Resolution Steps

- Both edited the same line in `README.md`
- During the virtual session, we:
  - Pulled latest changes
  - Used Git conflict markers to merge both edits
  - Committed resolved file together
- See attached screenshots in `/screenshots`

## Usage

1. Open `contact.html` in any browser
2. Fill in all fields and submit
3. Observe validation and confirmation message
